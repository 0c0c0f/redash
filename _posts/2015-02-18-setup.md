The [provisioning script](https://github.com/EverythingMe/redash/blob/master/setup/bootstrap.sh) works on Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 14.04 and Debian Wheezy. This script installs all needed dependencies and creates basic setup.

To ease the process, there are also images for AWS and Google Compute Cloud. These images created with the same provision script using Packer.

## Create an instance

### Google Compute Engine

First, you need to add the images to your account:

```bash
$ gcutil addimage redash-040b563 gs://redash-images/redash-040b563.tar.gz
```

Then you need to launch an instance with this image (we use n1-standard-1 instance type).

Now proceed to ["Setup"](#setup).

### AWS

Launch the instance with from the pre-baked AMI (for small deployments t2.micro should be enough):

eu-west-1: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=eu-west-1#LaunchInstanceWizard:ami=ami-1379f064    
us-east-1: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#LaunchInstanceWizard:ami=ami-0e2a6466      
us-west-2: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-west-2#LaunchInstanceWizard:ami=ami-334f1503  

If you want to launch it in a different region, please let us know and we will generate a new image.

Now proceed to ["Setup"](#setup).

### Other

Download the provision script and run it on your machine. Note that:

1. You need to run the script as root.
2. It was tested only on Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 14.04 and Debian Wheezy.

## Setup

Once you created the instance with either the image or the script, you should have a running
re:dash instance with everything you need to get started. You can even login to it with the user "admin" (password: "admin"). But to make it useful, there are a few more steps that you need to manually do to complete the setup:

First ssh to your instance and change directory to `/opt/redash`. If you're using the GCE image, switch to root (`sudo su`).

### Users & Google Authentication setup

Most of the settings you need to edit are in the `/opt/redash/.env` file.

1. Update the cookie secret (important! otherwise anyone can sign new cookies and impersonate users): change "veryverysecret" in the line: `export REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET=veryverysecret` to something else (you can use `pwgen 32 -1` to generate random string).

2. By default we create an admin user with the password "admin". It's nice for demos but obviously won't fly for production. You can change the password by going into '/opt/redash/current' and typing: `sudo -u redash bin/run ./manage.py users password admin {new password}` (there is an open issue #315 to support changing password from the UI).

3. If you want to use Google OAuth to authenticate users, you need to register with Google (see instructions) and then add the needed configuration in the `.env` file:

  ```bash
  export REDASH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=""
  export REDASH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=""
  export REDASH_GOOGLE_APPS_DOMAIN=""
  ```

  `REDASH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `REDASH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` are the values you get after registering with Google. `READASH_GOOGLE_APPS_DOMAIN` is used in case you want to limit access to certain Google apps domain (if you leave it empty anyone with a Google account can access your instance).

4. If you have Google OAuth enabled you can just login to your instance, but if you want to grant admin permissions to your user, you can run: `sudo -u redash bin/run ./manage.py users grant_admin {email}`.

5. If you don't use Google OAuth or just need username/password logins, you can create additional users with the CLI (read [this wiki page](https://github.com/EverythingMe/redash/wiki/Users-management) for more information).

### Datasources

To make re:dash truly useful, you need to setup your data sources in it. Currently all data sources management is done with the CLI:

```bash
$ sudo -u redash bin/run ./manage.py ds new "name" "type" "options"
```

See details in the [wiki](https://github.com/EverythingMe/redash/wiki/Managing-data-sources) for the different options. Your instance comes ready with dependencies needed to setup PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Redshift and MySQL sources.

Follow issue #193 to know when UI was implemented to manage data sources.

### How to upgrade?

It's recommended to upgrade once in a while your re:dash instance to benefit from bug fixes and new features. See [here](https://github.com/EverythingMe/redash/wiki/Upgrade-Instructions) for full upgrade instructions (including Fabric script).

## Misc

* If this is a production setup, you should enforce HTTPS and make sure you set the cookie secret.
